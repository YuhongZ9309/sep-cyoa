You and the other heroes gather together in the royal hall after the King explained that you would need a team to help you. Different adventures started to choose which heroes they want to form a party with.  
  
Unfortunately, all the adventures went to the other teams leaving you with no one to pair up with. You asked them why doesn’t anyone want to team up with me, but they all responded they want to go to the people who they want to in their own accordance. You now are frustrated with whatever thing that had gone on during this world. First being disrespected by the king, then no one wants to be in your team because you’re the shield hero.   
  
Then you saw a beautiful lady who was in the spear’s hero team and said she wants to volunteer to join your team. In your mind, she seems to be very precious and decide that you must protect her no matter the cost.  
  
As she joined your team, you decide that you should go hunting so you can level up. The young lady told you that she wants to go somewhere before they venture out. You arrived at a weapon shop as she told you that it's the best one she known. She asked the shop owner to pick out a basic armor you can use to protect your self. However, you weren’t paying attention to what they were saying and tried picking a sword to fight. You pick up a sword you felt a shock blazing through your body, you tried with other sword and it happens again. You realized that the system prevents you from using any other weapon than a shield.  
  
After preparing, you finally head out for your first hunt of the day. You killed many different types of monsters and collected their crystal fragments after they die and disappear into the air.  You decide that it was enough for the day and want to get back before nightfalls. You know realized that these crystals make a good amount of money and should invest in better gears. On the other hand, you are starving and wanted to take your partner out for dinner.
