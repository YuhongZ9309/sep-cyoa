“Please excuse me, your majesty. I still haven’t finished my introduction yet.”  
  
“Oh yes, forgive me. Please carry on with your self-introduction. And, addressing me as ‘King’ is fine.”  
  
You nodded and accepted the King’s apologizes. You continue to introduce yourself. Once you finished, the King disregarded your introduction and carried on with what he was about to explain before. You received a feeling of being ignored and neglected.    
    
The king proceeds with his explanations of what is going on and why you and the other three heroes were summoned.  
  
“There is a series of incursions of destructive forces in this world, came to know as *Waves*. If the calamity brought by the waves is not stopped, the world will meet its end. We have underestimated the first wave and barely survived. We realize that the four cardinal heroes are our only hope. This is the reason we have summoned you, heroes — to put a stop in this calamity and find peace in this world.”  
  
Up to this point, you realize that everything has been happening exactly as the book has described. You and the three other heroes seem to get a gist of the whole conflict and what is your objective here. As you all gain confidence and walk out of the hall, the King’s advisor stops you.  
  
“I neglected to mention, you are all beginners, only level 1.   You must go out and fight different types of monsters to level up and gain special abilities. To advance in levels more quickly, you must each recruit allies and adventure separately. It is said by nature that the heroes cannot work together as it will hinder your development.”  
  
“Summoners, now you all will find a member who you will form parties with. Remember, together you will work together to earn experience and level up. Please choose your partner *wisely*.”    
  
Would you rather find a member or go by yourself?
