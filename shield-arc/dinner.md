You decide after a long day of work, you’re going to go out to a fancy restaurant.  Midway through the dinner, you had fallen asleep. You woke up in the middle of the night and notice that she was gone.    
  
“Where are you?” You yelled.  You panicked. “Did she gets kidnapped or killed?”    
   
You rushed to back to your own but everything you had own was gone. You rushed outside and saw guards outside waiting for you. You don’t know what happened. In the morning, you were accused of sexually assaulting a young woman and that girl told a terrible lie that got your blood boiling.   
  
You decide to not trust anyone anymore and went to a slave shop to purchase a slave that you’ll be able to tame that is obedient. Now, your adventure starts here. It is going to be a rough one and you might encounter many obstacles but you now have someone that can never disobey what you said. You only can depend on yourself. You will continue to protect the kingdom because it’s your job as a hero.
