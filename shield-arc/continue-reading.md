After flipping through some of the pages, you read more about what each hero does. Suddenly, you encounter a blank page and felt a strange feeling as the book glow golden yellow. You started to feel light-headed and then became unconscious. A few moments later, you woke up in a place that you had never seen before. You looked around trying to get a sense of where you are at.  
  
"Fantastic the summoning was successful. Brave heroes, would you please save our world with pure evil?"  
  
You looked up and see a group of priests who have begged me to save their world. Then, you notice you were summoned along with 3 other people, who are the heroes with their unique weapon. You look down at your right hand, apparently, you have received the shield — the one which others believe the most useless. You even believed that the shield is not a real weapon; it is more like a type of armor. The groups of priests guide you to a giant, golden castle.  
  
“Greetings, the four cardinal heroes of ancient legend. This is the land of Melromarc and I am her king, Aultcray Melromarc XXXII. Now heroes, please identify yourself...”  
  
The other 3 heroes finished introducing themselves and you were about to introduce yourself too. But suddenly, the King interrupts you and starts to explain the situation and the reason why we are all summoned.  

What do you do?
