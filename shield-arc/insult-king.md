## END

“Yo King, aren’t you skipping someone?” 
“I’m of one the four cardinal heroes that you’ve just summoned and how dare you already disrespect someone that is going to save your country. You’re a trash king that doesn’t know how to respect people and govern a country. You are probably adopted into the royal family by a queen. What a joke! **Adopted royalty**.”  
  
The king, with anger and terror, said “Guard, Guard! Take this devil  out of my site!”   
  
“Executed him even if he a hero or a child of the goddess. **Execute him, now!”  
  
The guards follow the king’s order and rush to you. As you defend against them and told them that you can kill them in an instant if you want. Priests rushed toward the area and start chanting an unknown spell that you don’t know about. As a magic circle starts appearing you feel light-headed once more and became unconscious. You wait up in your room, and reach for the alarm clock.   

“It is only 9 o’clock. Good thing that was only a dream.”
