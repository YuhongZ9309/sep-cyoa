## END

You decide to head out by yourself because you trust no one. You went out of the capital and decide to go into a dungeon, not realizing is what awaits for you. You decide to explore deeper into the dungeon and realized that you were lost. After a while, you encounter minotaur and decide to fight it. But soon to realize, you cannot wield any type of weapons except for that shield you are given.  
  
You panicked and really need some help. You regret for not listening to that old man’s advice. You should of find a partner so you wouldn’t experience this horror. The minotaur comes, charging at you and swings his ax. You tried to defend the attack by using your shield. however, the ax ends up breaking your shield and penetrated your skin. You see blood spewing out.   
  
You have lost consciousness and total blackout.  
  
*YOU DIED*
