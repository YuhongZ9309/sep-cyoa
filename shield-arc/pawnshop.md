## END
  
After finish hunting, you decide to go back to the shop and decide that you need an upgrade. Your partner also told you that you should get her a good upgrade so she can be much stronger and can help you more efficiently. In your mind, you can only think about her and her safety, so you decide to buy her a better set of armories. She picked out the most expensive armor and weapons. Once she receives the new armor and weapons, she now told you that she had an errand to run and left.   
  
The next day, she never came back and you decide to look for her. You walked around and saw her in the spearâ€™s heroes team. You confronted her and ask her what was she doing. She said that you were trying to abuse her tonight and is in need of protection. You were confused when she had said that. Guards had surrounded you and you were captured back to the royal capital.  
  
You were accused of assault on a young woman and was stripped from your title of the shield hero. Your name was tarnished and you seek vengeance towards the king and the women. You left and vow to never come back.
