The day is about to end, so you said "Goodbye!" and walk home alone. As you are walking, you think about how to save her from this mystery and make everyone aware of her existence. You seem to be the only person that can see her and remember her. She also attend the same high school as you. Not to mention, you have feelings for her.  
   
Once you got home safely, you sat down on the couch and suddenly, an idea pops up. If you are the only person to notice her existence, then can you just remind everyone around that she exist? You also think that this would be a great chance for you to confess to her. Two birds with one stone. Not bad.  
  
Over the span of two weeks, you've been mustering up the courage to confess infront of the whole school. Between those time, you also have been spending time with her. Together, you went to crowded place to find someone who can see her, but sadly you found no one who can see her. You even travelled to a different city to find at least someone who can see her.   
   
One morning, you notice your memories of her starts to fade.  
  
What do you do?
