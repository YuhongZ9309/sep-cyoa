You rushed outside to the playground day break time. You take a deep breath and yelled, "I am in love with you, xxxx. xxxx I love you!" "I love you xxxx" "I love you very much!" 

You continue shouting about the moment you've spent with her and how you chereish them.

People in school started to look outside the window and look at you. You turn around and see her standing right in front of you. She runs towards you and slaps you, but then she HUGS you. You notice that she is blushing. She quitely wispered, "Idiot, I love you too"

Congrats, you got a girlfriend!
