 You're currently in your juniors year of high school. In a warm Sunday afternoon, you decided to take a stroll to the library because you are a completely *normal* nerd. On your way to the library, you encounter a busy street.  
 
 Would you be a good public citizen and wait for the pedestrian light or you would be that person living on the edge and jay-walk?
