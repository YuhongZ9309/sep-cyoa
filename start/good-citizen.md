## Congraluation!

You made the right choice to wait for the pedestrian light. Once the pedestrian light turned green, you walked and arrived at the library safely.  

At the library, you decide to look for a book to read and looked inside the mythology aisle. As you are strolling through the aisle, you came across a book that caught your attention. You reach high to get it and the first time you laid your hands on it, it was old and dusty. The book is called *"The Four Cardinal Weapons"*, written by anonymous. You find it interesting and takes the book with you.
